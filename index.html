                <p>
                    There are tours that you can book in Iceland that
                    will provide transportation by bus, with preset
                    destinations. This may be a valid option if you are
                    travelling alone and want to meet knew people. This
                    will also the eliminate the need to rent a car and 
                    pay for gas, which can be very expensive without 
                    friends to split the cost.
                </p>

                    If travelling with friends, renting a car is a great
                    option for getting around the country. Gas prices are 
                    high here, but splitting costs with one or more friends
                    will make it manageable. Driving is very straightforward
                    here, with one major highway going around the majority of
                    the country. This will give you the freedom to visit the 
                    locations you prefer, and on your own schedule.

                    Going out to eat in Iceland can be very expensive.
                    The country has to import the majority of its food,
                    as land conditions prevent them from producing a lot
                    of food of their own. You should be able to finder 
                    cheaper food prices at grocery stores, but restaurants
                    will empty your wallet very quickly. It is advised to
                    visit grocery stores to supply at least some of your food,
                    and maybe try a few restaurants that peak your interest.

                    Rejkjavik
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rejkjavik is Iceland's major city, however it is still
                    only a small town. Downtown is very accessible, and is
                    probably best traversed on foot. There are many restaurants
                    and shops to visit here, as well some nice parks, and the 
                    water front. While the city is certainly not as stunning as
                    some of the nature you will see in the rest of the country, 
                    it is still worth at least a few hours to wander, if you can
                    spare the time, as you will likely be passing through anyway
                    coming from the airport.

                    The Golden Circle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Golden Circle is an excellent day trip that contains
                    several great locations to stop and enjoy. It is very easy
                    to access, as you can start and end the loop in Rejkjavik.
                    Along the journey, you can stop and see several breathtaking
                    waterfalls, a hiking trail with interesting rock formations
                    from techtonic shifts, as well as a natural geysir that erupts
                    every 5 to 10 minutes.

                <h2>
                    Vestmannayjar Island
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The island of Vestmannayjar lies just south of the mainland,
                    and will take a bit more planning to travel to, however it is 
                    well worth the journey. From the south of the mainland, you will
                    need to take a roughly 30 minute ferry ride down to the island.
                    You are also able to ferry your car across, which is recommended if
                    you want to see the full island. The town in the center of the island
                    is very small, but the outskirts of the island contains several mountains
                    and volcanoes that you can hike, as well as several beaches on the outer
                    edges that you can enjoy.
